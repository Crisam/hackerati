This git repository was created for the assessment of my Javascript programming abilities. The application/widget will be a calendar created
only using plain javascript (vanilla javascript) HTML and CSS. I will use a bootstrap UI and node JS to run the application.
The widget will be hosted on a Heroku deployment platform for observation purposes.

All instructions , bug fixes and version updates confirmations will be place here in this readme file. You will be able to have access to it on GITHUB.
